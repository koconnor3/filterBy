# Red Labels for Pivotal Tracker

This Chrome extension for Pivotal Tracker makes it very easy to see which of
your stories are assigned to yourself in all panels (rather than the all encompassing and unsort-able 'My Work' panel)

## Taxonomy

Any story preview elements where 'owner.title'!={{your name}} will be hidden

## Future Work

- ability to set the name being filtered (instead of my own name hard-coded)
- clicking icon toggles filter
- keyboard shortcut to toggle filter
- create my own icon set so I'm not stealing the 'Red Labels for Pivotal Tracker' icon
